The Nintendo DS can be a lot of fun. It’s a mobile gaming console that you can bring with you anywhere and features many of your Nintendo favorites like Mario Kart, The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, and more. However, if you have never owned a mobile gaming console before it might seem a bit intimidating to learn how to actually use it. Fortunately, it won't be too difficult with a little help.
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Preparing to Play
1
Buy a Nintendo DS. You can buy the console from Nintendo, or from any number of online stores. Enter 'Buy Nintendo DS' into an internet search and you will find a bunch of options to buy from. Prices range anywhere from $20.00 to $60.00 depending on if you are buying the console new, used, or refurbished.
2
Buy the games you want to play. Some classic Nintendo series and characters include Donkey Kong, the Legend of Zelda, Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Mario World. If you have no idea what kind of game you want to play, starting with one of these could be a good bet. Everyone else seemed to like them and you might too!
3
Charge the system. Before you use the Nintendo DS for the first time, the battery must be fully charged. [1]
To do this, you'll want to find the power adapter in the package that your Nintendo DS came in. It should be labeled as the power adapter. Take the small end of the adapter and plug it into the plug at the back of your Nintendo DS labeled 5.2v ln. On the other end of the adapter, swing the prongs out of adapter until they lock into place. Now you can go ahead and insert the adapter into a normal 120 volt wall plug. [2]
Once the system begins to charge, an orange light will turn on. Once it is fully charged it will go off and that's how you will know you are ready to play.
Always unplug the adapter from the wall before unplugging it from the Nintendo DS.
Your battery is good for at least 500 full charges before it starts losing steam. Keep that in mind for future reference. [3]

Method 2 of 3:Starting the Nintendo DS
1
Look on the right side of the DS. You will see a button with a power symbol on the side of it.It is a little circle with a bar through it. To turn it on, push this button up up.
A light on the top will turn bright green when you have done it correctly. If the light doesn't come up, try again. Remember, you're pushing up - not in.
2
Open the DS by gently pulling the top screen up. Make sure the screen is in a position that you can comfortable view it. You'll want it to sit at a slight angle.
3
Look to the side of the Nintendo DS and pull out the stylus. You will use the stylus to press buttons on the touch screen and play games.  Tap things on your screen with the stylus to select them.
4
Touch the bottom screen. This is the touch screen and the one you will be using to navigate most often. The Nintendo sign will show up as the system powers on.
5
Answer the questions as the system prompts you. If you just bought it, it will ask you questions about yourself. Answer them using the touch screen and the stylus.
The buttons are B, A, Y and X. The A button usually is the enter button, and can be also used to confirm settings. B is normally the backspace button that usually cancels commands. X and Y depend on what game you are playing.

Method 3 of 3:Playing the Game
1
Look at the bottom of the Nintendo DS. You should see a big slot down there with a part covering it up. Remove this part and enter whatever game you want to play into the slot. Make sure that the pins on the game line up with the pins in the slot. Entering the game into the Nintendo DS the wrong way can damage the system.
2
Power on the Nintendo DS by pressing up on the "Power" button on the right side of the console. The game will normally automatically start playing but if it doesn't you can use the stylus to tap the box on the screen that says Nintendo DS Card Slot. Then the game will start playing. Follow the game specific prompts to move forward in the game or read the instruction manual that the game provides if you are having trouble navigating the game. Generally the 'Start', 'Select', 'A', and 'B' buttons will move you forward or back through the menus.
In some games, you can choose which screen to play on. Follow the game specific prompts to do so.
3
Play your game! Each game comes with a specific instruction manual that will tell you how to play. Every game is different, but generally you will move your character around using the arrow keys on the left of your Nintendo DS. The 'X' button is often the action key that will cause things to happen. Read your user manual and learn the specifics.
4
Get better. For some games you'll need to practice playing the game a lot and continuing practicing to get good at playing it, sort of like playing an instrument or a sport. However, other games require a large time commitment but not as much practice. For example if you play games where your character 'levels up', you don't have to worry about losing that level if you don't play the game for a while. Plan accordingly.
5
Save your game. Some games save automatically, and some have different saving mechanisms. For most games, you will press the 'X' button on the Nintendo DS and then choose the Save Game option in the menu that shows up.  [4]
6
Turn it off when you are done. This will help you save your battery for the next time you want to play. You can turn the Nintendo DS off by following the same method you used to turn it on. Look on the right side of the console until you find the 'Power' button. Slide this button down to power it off.
Tips
Read the instruction manual if you're having trouble.
Don't play for too long in one sitting. This can hurt your eyes and give you a headache.
Remember not to unplug the power adapter from the DS while it is charging. Always unplug it from the wall first.
Don't force the game into the game slot. If it isn't going in, you probably aren't putting it in the correct way. Check to make sure the pins on the game line up with the pins in the system.
