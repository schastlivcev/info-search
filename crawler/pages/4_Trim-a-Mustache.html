How to Trim a Mustache

The mustache is a classic look for men, but over time they can grow out and look unruly. If you want to control your mustache and keep it looking clean, all you need are a few basic grooming products. While a basic trim works for most styles, a handlebar mustache requires a few extra steps. Work with your mustache and groom it regularly to keep it clean!

Method 1 of 2:Cleaning up Your Mustache
1
Comb through your mustache with a fine-toothed comb. Combing helps straighten your facial hair so you can trim it evenly.[1]

Use a smaller comb meant for facial hair for the most convenience. Keep your mustache dry while you do this so you know the true length of your facial hair.
Shampoo and condition your facial hair before you trim if you want to make your mustache softer and easier to manage. Beard shampoo is preferable, but you can use regular hair shampoo if that's all you have.[2]

Just make sure you completely dry your face after.

Cut along your lip with a pair of trimming scissors or electric trimmers. Keep your face expressionless as you trim so you can easily see if you're trimming your mustache evenly. Hold the trimming scissors parallel to your lips and make small cuts following your lip line. The length is dependent on your preference. If you're using electric trimmers, gently press the edge of the trimmer to the top of your lip line and pull it away.[3]
Work from the outside of your mustache towards the center. Once you reach the center from one side, start from the end of your mustache on the opposite side.
3
Trim the top of your mustache to make a clean line. Use your trimming scissors or a precision razor to cut off any unruly hair. If you're using a razor, use short strokes pulling up and away from the rest of your mustache.[4]
You can cut the top of your mustache so it goes at a 45-degree angle towards your lips or leave it so it looks fuller. The shape of the top of your mustache all depends on your own personal preference.
Trim the area where your mustache meets your nose so it doesn't look like long nose hair.
4
Reduce the volume of your mustache with a comb and scissors. Comb up and away from your mustache so the ends of your facial hair extend past the comb's teeth. Use your scissors or electric trimmers to trim the hair. This helps control the length and bulk of your mustache.[5]
Some electric trimmers come with guides that will work as a replacement for a comb. Start on the longer settings first and work your way to a shorter length. Avoid using electric clippers without a guard or comb since you could easily cut off too much hair.[6]

Start by trimming only a little at a time. You can always trim more off, but you have to wait for it to grow back if you cut too much.

Check for any hairs you missed. Comb your beard again to straighten your mustache and look for any long hairs that you missed the first time. Use your scissors to trim them back to their desired length. Turn your head to the side and check if any hair sticks out more than the others.
Method 2
Method 2 of 2:Shaping and Styling a Handlebar Mustache
1
Lift the ends of your mustache and shave to the corners of your lips. The ends of your mustache will be the longest since they will be twisted to form the classic handlebar look. Pinch the long hair between your fingers and pull it up to reveal any stubble underneath. Use a precision razor to shave any hair underneath.[7]
Leave a little extra volume in your mustache while you're trimming. The hair will make your handlebar mustache look fuller and give you more hair to curl.
2
Twist the ends of your mustache and trim them for length if needed. Use your index finger and your thumb to twist the hair together so it's easier to trim. Work on one side of your mustache at a time and make sure they are even in length.[8]
Pull each side of your mustache out to ensure they are the same length when you're finished trimming them.
Cut a little bit at a time so you don't remove too much from your handlebar.
3
Rub a fingertip-sized amount of mustache wax between your fingers. Warm the wax in between your fingers using a circular motion. Start with a little bit of wax since you can always add more later if your curls don't hold.
Mustache wax can be purchased online or in most haircare sections of local stores.
4
Work the wax into your mustache. Start in the center of your mustache and pat it towards the ends. Continue working the wax into your mustache until it is completely clear. Comb your mustache from the middle toward each side so all of your facial hair is going in the same direction.[9]
Combing your mustache will also help evenly distribute the wax so it isn't bunched up in one place.
5
Pinch the ends of the mustache and twist them away from your face. Rub another fingertip-sized amount of wax between your index finger and your thumb and grab the ends of your mustache. Pull the hairs from the middle of your mustache to the ends, and twist the hair away from your cheek. Repeat the process for the other end of your mustache until it curls how you want it.[10]
Use more product if you have long hair since it will be more difficult to control.
6
Use extra-hold gel to keep the curls in place. Use a small bead of clear gel and rub it into the ends of your mustache. This will secure the curls so they last throughout the day and will glue it in place.
You can also use more of the mustache wax to hold it in place, though it is more likely to droop after time.
