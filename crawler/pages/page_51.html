Last Updated: August 9, 2021
If you look at your profile in the mirror and notice that your upper body hunches forward, then you likely have rounded shoulders. This condition can develop as a result of spending too much time bending forward or can stem from weakened back or shoulder muscles. To restore your shoulders to their natural position, develop an exercise and stretching routine that you complete each day. Many of these movements only take minutes and can have a lasting impact. Also, make an appointment with your doctor to discuss medical treatment options.
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Strengthening Your Back and Shoulder Muscles
1
Hold a shoulder blade squeeze. This is a simple strengthening move that can be done pretty much anywhere. Stand up tall and straight. Slowly flex your shoulder blades back and together. Imagine suspending a pencil in between your shoulder blades.[1]
Hold this position for a least 10 seconds for around 10 reps. To see real benefits, do this squeeze move between 3-4 times each day.
2
Perform a wide pushup. Get into standard pushup position on an exercise mat. Instead of placing your palms on the mat, move them on to 2 yoga blocks placed a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Then, bend your elbows and lower yourself towards the mat, as you would with a standard pushup. Flex your muscles and lift back up and repeat.[2]
Make sure to keep your back straight and not bowed or you will lose any health benefit.
Perform this exercise daily and start out with 3 sets of 15 reps each. You can always challenge yourself by trying to hold a lowered position for longer periods.
This is a helpful exercise because it provides a deep stretch for your back and improves your muscle tone.

Complete a wall slide press. Stand up straight with your back fully against a solid wall. Bend your elbows at a 90-degree angle with your arms pressed against the wall. Keep your forearms against the wall and move your arms toward the ceiling until your thumbs touch one another. Then, slowly lower your arms and elbows back into the starting position.[3]
Try to hold the fingers of each hand together as you move your arms. Your knuckles should graze against the wall as you move.
Do this exercise daily. When you are starting out, try to complete 3 sets of 15 reps. You can make this exercise more difficult by adding weight cuffs to your wrists.
Method 2
Method 2 of 3:Stretching Your Back and Shoulder Muscles
1
Do a thoracic release. Lie down with your back on an exercise mat. Place a foam roller in a horizontal position under the middle of your back. Lock both hands behind your neck. Roll the roller back and forth up and down your spine. When you reach the top and bottom parts of your spine hold that position for 10 seconds and repeat the process.[4]
You can stretch your neck down to touch your head to the mat as well. This will help to relieve any pressure on your neck.
The number of rolls or reps that you complete really depend on your fitness level. Many people prefer to do 2 sets of 10 reps. For the best results, do this exercise daily.
2
Do a chin tuck exercise. Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat with your arms to your sides and your knees bent. Without lifting your head off the mat, do your best to create a double chin or multiple double chins. Then, hold your head just off the ground and try the same movement.[5]
This exercise is often used by swimmers to prevent a rounded swimmers back or shoulders. It helps to stretch out your neck muscles in a gentle way.
You can repeat this exercise as often as you choose. Do it at least once daily for the best results.
3
Perform a doorway pec stretch. Stand up straight in the opening of a doorway. Raise your hands above your head and try to keep your elbows at a 90 degree angle. Place your forearms flat against the door jamb of the door. Rotate forward on the balls of your feet until you start to feel a stretch in your pec muscles. Rock back into your original position and repeat.[6]
This is a convenient stretch that you can do as often as you want and almost anywhere. It also gives you control regarding how far you want to stretch forward.
4
Hold a T-position on the floor. Lie down flat on an exercise mat with your knees bent. Extend your arms out to your sides with your palms facing upwards. Your body should look like a t-shape from overhead. Hold this position for about 10 minutes. It will help to loosen up your pectoral muscles.[7]
Performing this stretch first thing in the morning can give you loose pecs throughout the day.
5
Massage your pecs with a tennis ball. Position a tennis ball up between your shoulder bone and collarbone where your pec muscles lie. Then, push your body against a wall corner. Tilt your face into the corner and let your body hold the ball up. Move your body around and let the ball massage your pecs.[8]
As you massage, you’ll likely hit a few tender spots. Just hold the ball in place until you feel the knot start to break apart.
Give yourself at least 1 massage each day for maximum benefits.

Method 3 of 3:Following General Treatment Advice
1
Assess your posture by looking in the mirror. Stand directly in front of a mirror and try to relax your posture as much as possible. Look at your hands. If your knuckles are facing towards the mirror, then you likely have rounded shoulders. You can also position yourself with a side view of the mirror to see how far your shoulders are bent forward.[9]

Sit up straight with your shoulders pushed back. Scoot back until the bottom of your spine is flush against the back of your chair. Keep your knees bent at a right angle. Imagine holding a pencil between your shoulder blades to help keep your shoulders from slumping. Adjust the height of your chair, so that you can look ahead of you without peering downward.[10]

Try not to cross your legs, as this throws off your spinal alignment.
3
Avoid repetitive downward-facing motions. As a general rule, try to get up from whatever you are doing and take a break at least every 30 minutes. Staring at your computer or phone all day can cause your neck and back muscles to tense up and push your shoulders forward. If you need to, set an alarm on your phone to remind you to stand up and stretch a bit.[11]
Once you stand up, stretch your arms towards the sky and look up as well. Jog a bit in place while looking forward. Take a quick trip up and down some stairs.
4
Get at least 600 IU of vitamin D each day as an adult. Since vitamin D helps to build strong bones and muscles, it’s important that you get enough from both your diet and supplementation. Eat foods fortified with vitamin D, such as cheese or orange juice. Take vitamin D supplements to reach your daily recommended amount.[12]
For adults, the recommended daily intake is 600 IU of vitamin D. If you are older than 70, that minimum number goes up to 800 IU daily.
Your doctor can do a blood test to check if you are vitamin D deficient.
5
Talk with your doctor for assistance. If you are struggling with rounded shoulders, make an appointment to see your general doctor to rule out any additional health concerns. Your doctor will likely conduct a full physical examination and may refer you on to a neck and back specialist. In some cases, untreated rounded shoulders can lead to chronic back pain and migraines.
Tips
If you are working on a computer all day, try to elevate it with books or risers so that it is at or above eye level. This will keep you from looking downward and hunching your shoulders.
Warnings
If your rounded shoulders are painful, your doctor might suggest taking over-the-counter pain relievers to minimize any discomfort. Just make sure to follow the dosage instructions carefully.
