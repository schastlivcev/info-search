Click the "Settings"  gear. It's in the top-right side of the Gmail inbox. A drop-down menu will appear.
3
Click Settings. This option is in the middle of the drop-down menu. Doing so opens the Settings page.
4
Click the Accounts and Import tab. You'll find this tab near the top of the Settings page.
5
Click Import mail and contacts. It's a link in the "Import mail and contacts" section. Clicking this link prompts a pop-up window.
You'll instead click Import from another address here if you've previously imported information from a different email account.[1]

Enter your Yahoo email address when prompted. You'll do this in the text field that's in the middle of the pop-up window.

Per Google's notes, it may take up to two days for new emails to show up in your Gmail inbox.
