In Spanish, as in English, there are many ways to say goodbye, as well as related phrases about saying goodbye. You may not end up using most of them, but it's still great to learn as many as you can. That way you can be prepared for any situation, and you'll be able to talk to lots of different people. Go beyond "adiós" and you might even be mistaken for a fluent or native speaker![1]
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Saying Goodbye in Person
1
Start with the basics. The word you've probably heard before, or learned in a phrasebook, is adiós. You can think of adiós as approximately equivalent to "farewell" in English. In practice, this word isn't used as much as you might think.
Typically Spanish speakers use it if they won't be seeing the other person for a longer period of time, if ever again. For example, if you were ending a relationship with a significant other, you might say "adiós."
2
Say goodbye in a casual or informal way with "te veo." This phrase uses the familiar tú form of "you" and basically means "I'll see you." Pronounce it tay VAY-oh. This is a casual form that shouldn't be used with anyone you're expected to address formally, such as your teacher or boss.[2]
You also can say "nos vemos" (nohs VAY-mohs), which literally means "we see ourselves." The phrase's actual meaning is more like "we'll see each other later."
3
Say "bye" to your friends with chau. Sometimes spelled "chao," this is another friendly, informal way to say goodbye. It's technically an Italian word, but is used among Spanish speakers casually – similar to the way English speakers would say "peace" or "peace out."[3]
4
Use a phrase with the word hasta. In Spanish, "hasta" means "until." There are several phrases using this word that can be used to tell someone goodbye. Some of these phrases specifically say when you will next see the person.[4]
Hasta mañana means "until tomorrow." Pronounce it AHS-tuh men-YAHN-uh. This phrase is appropriate in both formal and informal settings. You also can use hasta with a specific day. For example, you might say "hasta el martes," to mean "see you on Tuesday."
Hasta luego (AHS-tuh loo-WAY-goh) is less specific, meaning "until later" or "see you later." Another way to say "until later" is hasta más tarde (AHS-tuh mahs TAR-day).
You also can say hasta pronto (AHS-tuh PRAHN-toh), which means "until soon" or "see you soon." This phrase is used less often than "hasta luego."
If the person to whom you're speaking has mentioned the time when the two of you will next see each other, you can say "hasta entonces" (AHS-tuh ehn-TAHN-says), which means "until then."
5
Avoid "hasta siempre" (AHS-tuh see-IMP-rray) in most circumstances. While the phrase "hasta siempre," meaning literally "until forever," is well known, it's not a phrase you want to use to say goodbye to someone because of its strong connotation of permanence.[5]
This phrase is more typically used when a couple is separated by death.
6
Tell someone "good night" by saying "buenas noches" (boo-EHN-uhs NOH-chays). Just as in English, if you are parting from someone in the evening, it is common to say "good night" rather than "goodbye."[6]
Unlike in English, buenas noches is used as both a greeting and a farewell. Depending on the context, it might mean "good evening" or "good night." The phrase is generally appropriate anytime after dinner.
7
Ask native speakers about local slang. Different Spanish-speaking countries, and even regions within a country, may have different slang phrases commonly used to say goodbye. When you're traveling, ask someone around your age what phrases are popular.
Learning a few slang greetings can help you blend in, especially if you'll be staying in the area for a longer period of time.
For instance, the phrase "pura vida" in Costa Rica can be a way to say goodbye. [7]

Method 2 of 3:Saying Goodbye in Writing
1
Use atentamente to close business correspondence. If you are writing a formal letter to a government department or business, the closing atentamente is the closest thing to saying "sincerely" in English, and the most commonly used.[8]
You also can say "le saluda atentamente," which is more like "sincerely yours." If the letter is addressed to more than one person, write this "les saluda atentamente."
2
Write cordialmente in more casual business correspondence. The closing "cordialmente" typically is used after you've established a more familiar relationship with the person to whom you're writing. It's appropriate for repeated correspondence when you have a regular business or collegial relationship with someone.[9]
3
Try more affectionate closings for personal letters. Closings for Spanish correspondence typically are more affectionate than those used in English, if you think about the direct translation of the words.[10]
There are other warm closings for personal letters, such as "un abrazo" (a hug), "cariñosos saludos" (similar to "kind regards"), or "afectuosamente" (affectionately).
4
Use besos y abrazos when writing to close friends and family. The Spanish phrase "besos y abrazos" literally means "kisses and hugs." As you can probably imagine, this closing is more appropriate if you're writing to someone you would actually hug or kiss on a regular basis.[11]
Some other closings you can use with family and close friends include "con todo mi cariño" (with all my caring) or "con todo mi afecto" (with all my affection).

Method 3 of 3:Understanding Related Phrases
1
Learn the noun form of goodbye. In English, you use the same word whether you're actually saying goodbye to someone or talking about saying goodbye. Spanish has a different word you should use if you're talking about saying goodbye.[12]
The noun form of goodbye in Spanish is "la despedida." For example, you might say "Supongo que es la despedida," or "I guess this is goodbye."
If you're talking about someone "saying goodbye" to something, use the word despedirse. For example, "puede despedirse del triunfo" means "he can say goodbye to his chances of winning."
2
Use cuídate (coo-EE-dah-tay) if you want to tell someone to "take care." In English, rather than saying goodbye specifically, you often tell the person to take care of themselves. The word cuídate in Spanish expresses the same thing.[13]
As in English, you also can combine this with other greetings. For example, you might say "¡Te veo, cuídate!" meaning "See ya, take care!"
3
Tell the person to have a good day. As in English, it's fairly common for Spanish speakers to say "have a nice day" rather than just "goodbye" or "see you later." A way to say this in Spanish is "¡Bueno, que tengas un buen día!"[14]
4
Seal it with a kiss. In Spanish-speaking countries, it is a cultural tradition to greet others as well as say goodbye with a kiss on the cheek. In Latin America, people usually give each other one kiss on opposite cheeks. In Spain, two kisses – one on each cheek – are common.[15]
If you are in a Spanish-speaking country, don't be taken aback if a stranger or someone you've just met kisses you goodbye. It's a basic cultural expression.
Tips
Warnings
The phrase "hasta la vista," despite its popularity in English, isn't commonly used in Spanish. Use it sparingly, if at all. If native speakers hear you using it they may take it as a joke, or even treat it as an outright blunder.
