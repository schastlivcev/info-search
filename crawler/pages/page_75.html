How to Store Fine China

Last Updated: April 27, 2021
If you have a set of fine china, chances are you don’t use it on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. More often than not, china dishes are something you might get out for special occasions once or twice a year. It’s up to you whether to display your fancy dishes or pack them away out of sight when they’re not in use. Either way, follow some general guidelines to keep your china in tip-top shape for years to come.
Method 1
Method 1 of 2:On Display
1
Store your china collection in a glass display cabinet to show it off year-round. Display cabinets with glass fronts keep your precious china safe from accidents and dust and let you showcase your favorite pieces. Arrange your best china inside the cabinet in a visually appealing way and keep pieces from touching one another.[1]
For example, place the smallest, most delicate items like cups and stemware on the top shelves of the cabinet. Put larger items like plates, bowls, and pitchers on the lower shelves and arrange some teacups or other interesting pieces in front of them to make the display look nice.
If you have an extensive china set, put the pieces that you use the most or that you like the best in the display cabinet, then pack the rest away in storage containers to take out on the special occasions when you need more dishes.
2
Put plates in a plate rack when you store them on a shelf or in a cabinet. Store displayed plates vertically whenever possible to save space and avoid stacking them. The edges of plates are actually the strongest parts and plates are less likely to get damaged if they’re stored vertically.[2]
Make sure that the rack you use keeps the plates separate, so they don’t bump into one another.
3
Display bowls, cups, and mugs rim-side-up to prevent damage. Place these types of dishes right-side-up individually and avoid stacking them whenever possible. This prevents chipping on the most fragile parts of your valuable china pieces.[3]
Don’t store china cups by hanging them from the handle. It might seem like a great space saving idea, but the handles are delicate and prone to breakage if you store them this way.
4
Place a piece of tissue paper or foam between any stacked pieces. Fold up a piece of acid-free tissue paper, so that it’s a few layers thick, or use a square of polyethylene foam. Put a piece in between each stacked piece of china, such as between every plate, to prevent them from touching and potentially chipping or cracking.[4]
In a pinch, use a napkin, a paper towel, or a paper plate between stacked dishes. Anything soft that keeps the dishes from touching is better than nothing!
Avoid using newspapers because the ink rubs off and makes a mess on your china.
5
Dust off your collection every 6-12 months. Use a soft brush, like a sable paint brush, to gently dust off all your displayed china pieces once or twice a year. This prevents dust from getting embedded in any unglazed surfaces or hairline cracks and keeps your pieces looking clean and beautiful.[5]
If the brush you use has any metal bits on it, be careful not to scratch the china. Only let the bristles of the brush touch your dishes.
Method 2
Method 2 of 2:In Storage Bins
1
Pack un-displayed pieces into small plastic containers to store them safely. China is heavy, so opt for small containers to avoid overpacking them. Use sealable plastic containers to provide long-lasting protection that also keeps moisture out.[6]
Avoid using cardboard boxes to store your precious china. They get squished easily and are prone to water damage.
2
Wrap each piece of china separately in bubble wrap or butcher’s paper. Either wrapping material is sufficient for home storage, but opt for bubble wrap if you’re planning to move your china. Wrap each plate, bowl, cup, saucer, lid, and any other pieces of china you have in its own piece of butcher’s paper or bubble wrap.[7]
Don’t use newspapers because the ink rubs off on dishes, meaning more unnecessary washing for you to do whenever you want to use the china.
3
Turn plates and bowls sideways to avoid stacking them. Slide plates vertically into the storage bins. Do the same for bowls, but pack some extra butcher’s paper or bubble wrap around them to keep them steady on their sides in the bins.[8]
Stacking items puts a lot of weight on them and makes them more prone to damage if the bin gets accidentally dropped. Any weakened or damaged items are also prone to breakage if they’re stacked.
4
Place cardboard dividers between delicate items to keep them separate. Fold and bend pieces of cardboard into squares or circles to fit around things like stemware, tea cups, and mugs inside the storage bins. Put the cardboard dividers in between all the delicate pieces to prevent them from getting jostled and bumping into one another.[9]
There are also grid-shaped cardboard dividers available to purchase from packing material supply shops. Just make sure they’re big enough to fit your wrapped china if you choose to use these types of premade dividers.
5
Label containers with their contents to keep track of what’s inside. Write inventory lists for each bin that include the types of dishes that are inside and how many of them there are. Tape the lists to the outsides of the bins.[10]
That way you know exactly where everything is when you go to dig out certain dishes once or twice a year or when you’re moving.
6
Store your bins of china at room temperature in a climate-controlled space. Pick an area to keep the bins where you have control over the temperature year round. Keep china out of extreme heat and cold, which can damage painted details and cause cracking.[11]
Avoid stacking the plastic bins, so there’s no excessive weight on your boxes of precious china.
Tips
There are also special quilted and padded storage bags made to fit dishes of all shapes and sizes. Consider purchasing some of these if you want a specialized china storage solution.
Warnings
Avoid stacking china whenever possible. It’s OK to stack plates as long as you are careful and place something soft like acid-free tissue paper or packing foam between each plate to prevent them from touching.
Don’t hang china cups by their handles, especially if the handles have been repaired.
