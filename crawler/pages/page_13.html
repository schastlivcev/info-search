You'll care for your dentures the same way you would your natural teeth, but it's important to use products made for dentures. You can either brush your dentures or soak your dentures in a cleanser, depending on your preferences. Research suggests that you should never use denture cleansers in your mouth, so always clean your dentures after you remove them at night.[2]

Method 1
Method 1 of 2:Brushing your Dentures
1
Acquire a denture brush. A denture brush is recommended in order to clean all areas of the denture. If you prefer to use an ordinary toothbrush, use extra attention to reach all curved areas of your dentures. If you wear a single denture, you will need a separate brush for your denture in order to preserve the condition of the toothbrush you use on your natural teeth.[3]

2
Accident-proof your workspace. Start by accident-proofing the surface you will work over. Place a face cloth in the bottom of the sink and partially fill the sink with water to provide a cushion should the denture be dropped. Dentures can break if dropped on a hard surface.
Grasp the dentures in your non-dominant hand, but don't squeeze too hard. Dentures can break.
3
Apply warm water and cleaning product. You can use a gel or paste specifically designed for dentures or a little soap or other mild, non-toxic cleansing agent. Don't use regular toothpaste or any powdered or abrasive cleaners. They may scratch the denture and provide places for bacteria to thrive and may irritate your oral mucosa.[4]

Brush. With the denture brush in your dominant hand, brush all areas of the denture. Ensure that the bristles reach all the grooved and curved areas. Don't scrub too hard, though, as you don't want to damage your dentures.[5]

Rigorous brushing will help prevent the formation of tartar.
5
Rinse. Under running water, use the brush to rinse away remaining cleanser and debris. Inspect your denture for cleanliness. Areas that feel "slippery" may indicate that there is still plaque on the surface.[6]

Use your dentures. Now you can place the dentures back in your mouth if you are ready to wear them, or, if not, you can place them in water to soak them overnight.[7]

Method 2 of 2:Soaking your Dentures
1
Remove your dentures. Having the dentures out of your mouth for a period of time each day gives your tissues a rest from the constant contact. While out of your mouth, the denture should be kept moist. Soaking them overnight is a good way to do this.[8]

2
Use a chemical solution. Soaking your dentures in a chemical solution helps to loosen stains and deposits that can then be rinsed or brushed away. Specifically designed denture soak products are often also anti-microbial and offer other benefits.[9]

3
Select a proper container. Select a container with a fitted cover that is the appropriate size for your denture. Make sure you account for displacement of the liquid when selecting a container.
4
Follow package instructions. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation and length of soaking time. Use only warm water in order to promote the action of the cleanser. Hot water can distort the shape of your denture.[10]

Submerge the dentures. Ensure that the denture is completely submersed in the solution and cover the container. Do not leave any part of your denture out of the water or exposed to air.[11]

Clean the container. Empty and clean the soaking container. Pour out the used denture solution and clean the container thoroughly to make it ready for the next use. You will want to do this daily to ensure your dentures are as clean and fresh as possible.

Tips
Remember that periodic oral check-ups are recommended even if you no longer have any natural teeth. Consult your dental professional whenever you experience oral discomfort, notice the appearance of a lesion in your mouth, or if you have a problem with the fit of your denture.
When these cleaning methods are not sufficient to remove deposits, a professional cleaning of your dentures by a dental professional is recommended.
Look for the American Dental Association or Canadian Dental Association seal of approval to ensure that a denture cleaner has been evaluated for safety and effectiveness.
Most dental professionals recommend you rinse your dentures after every meal, and some may even advise brushing them after each meal. Rinsing helps keep plaque buildup to a minimum and makes it easier to clean them by brushing them in the evening.
Take special care if you have partial dentures with small metal wires that can break easily.
Warnings
Partial dentures with metal parts require greater care in cleaning. Ensure that the products you select are safe to use on your partial denture. Ask your dental professional if you are unsure of how to care for your partial denture.
If you feel nauseous or have any pain in your mouth or throat after putting a denture back in your mouth, contact your doctor immediately. If not rinsed away, chemicals in some denture soaking agents can cause serious side effects.
Avoid using regular toothpaste to clean your denture. The abrasive nature of paste designed for natural teeth can scratch a denture. Scratches are great places for stains and plaque to form.
