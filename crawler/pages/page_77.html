TikTok is a video-sharing social media platform that has exploded in popularity.  It features a massive library of music and sounds and an easy-to-use video editing system that allows users to create short, creative videos with music, sound effects, and visual effects.  This wikiHow teaches you how to film, edit, and publish a music video by using TikTok for iPhone and Android.

Tap Sounds.  It's at the top of the screen. This opens the Sounds menu. TikTok features an expansive library of music, including many popular artists.
If it's the first time you're using TikTok, you may have to give the app permission to use your microphone and camera.  Tap Allow to give it permission.

Type the name of a song or artist in the search bar.  The search bar is at the top of the screen.  This will display a list of search results from TikTok's library that match your search.
You can also tap one of the recommended songs below "For You" on the Sounds menu.

Many popular songs only allow you to use 15 seconds of music.  Generally, you will be allowed to choose which 15 seconds you want to use from a larger section of the song.

The lines that resemble a sound wave at the bottom will turn blue as the music progresses.  Tap and drag the lines at the bottom of the screen to change the starting point of a song.  The song will start over when you stop dragging. This allows you to instantly hear where the starting point of the song is at.

Part 2 of 4:Creating Your Video
1
Aim the camera at a subject. Your subject can be yourself or anything that else that you want to film.
To upload a video you recorded from your phone Gallery or Camera roll, tap Upload in the lower-right corner.  If the video is longer than 60 seconds, you will need to tap and drag the video at the bottom of the screen to select which section of the video you want to use.

Switch between the front and back cameras.  Tap the icon that resembles two arrows drawing the shape of a camera to switch between the camera on the front of your phone and the back of your phone.  It's at the top of the menu on the right.  Use your forward-facing camera to take a selfie.  Use the back-facing camera to take scenic shots.
3
Change the speed of the video.  Changing the speed of a video can add an interesting effect.  Filming fast can make your video feel light and energetic.  Filming in slow motion can make your videos seem more dramatic.  To change the speed of the video, tap the icon that resembles a speedometer on the right.  Then tap one of the speed options above the record button.  Your options are as follows:
Tap 0.3x  to slow down the video recording to about 1/3 normal speed.

Tap 1x to leave it at normal speed.
Tap 2x to record at double normal speed.
Tap 3x to record at three times normal speed.

Add effects to your video.  TikTok has a variety of special effects you can use, including many interactive and animated effects.  You can add fire to your face, add raindrops to a scene, club lighting, or a different background, just to name a few examples. Use the following steps to add effects to your video:
Tap the Effects icon in the lower-left corner.
Use tabs at the top of the effects list to browse the different categories of effects.
Then tap one of the effect icons to use it.
Watch the video feed on your phone to preview the effect.
Tap the icon that resembles a circle with a line through it next to the tabs to cancel effects.
Tap the video feed to close the effects list at the bottom.

Tap the tabs above the preview icons to browse filters by category.

7
Add a countdown timer (optional).  For some videos, you may need to get in position before it starts filming.  Especially if you are filming yourself.  Adding a countdown timer gives you a few seconds before the video starts recording to get in position.  Use the following steps to add a countdown timer:
Tap Timer in the menu to the right.  It has an icon that resembles a stopwatch.
Tap 3s or 10s in the lower-right corner to select a 3-second countdown timer, or a 10-second countdown timer.

Tap the record button at the bottom.  It's the large red button at the bottom of the screen. Your video will start recording immediately.  You can either dance, lip-sync, play an instrument, or do something else entertaining while the music plays.  Your video can be as much as 60 seconds long.  The blue bar at the top of the screen shows how much video time you have left.
You can also tap and hold the record button.  The video will stop recording when you release the record button.
While tapping and holding the "Record" button, drag the record button up the screen to zoom in.

Tap the Stop button to stop recording.  When you start recording, the Record button turns into a square.  Tap the square button to stop recording.
When you stop recording, notice the blue bar is still at the top of your screen.  If your video hasn't used the entire 60 seconds, you can tap the record button again to add another video clip after the one you've already recorded.  This is a great way to add multiple scenes and transitions to a video.
10
Tap X to delete the previous clip.  When filming a music video, you don't always get it right on the first shot.  That's okay.  If you need to redo the shoot, tap the arrow with an "x" in it in the lower-right corner and then tap Discard to delete the previous clip.  Tap the record button to try again.

Part 4 of 4:Posting Your Video to TikTok
1
Type a description of your video.  You're only allowed 150 characters in your description, including hashtags and tagged friends.  Keep your description as brief as possible and allow lots of room for hashtags.
2
Tap #Hashtag to add hashtags to the description.  Like with Twitter, you can add keywords or "Hashtags" to your video description to make it easier to search and find.  To add a hashtag, tap #Hashtag below your video description and type the hashtag word you want to add.  Add hashtags that are relevant and descriptive of your video.  Add as many as possible.  This will help you with the TikTok algorithm so that your video gets viewed by other TikTok users.
3
Tap @Friends to tag your friends.  It's below the video description at the top.  You can use this to notify your friends on TikTok or other creators you want to see the video.  Add the username of the friend you want to tag after the "@" symbol.
4
Set the privacy settings for the video.  To set the privacy settings for the video, tap Who can view this video below the description.  Select a privacy setting from the menu.  Your privacy settings are as follows:
Public:  This allows anyone on TikTok to search and view your video.
Friends:  This only allows your friends to view your video.
Private:  This makes the video only viewable by you.
5
Allow or disallow comments.  Tap the toggle switch next to "Allow comments" to turn comments on or off.  If people are allowed to comment on your video, this will allow for more video engagement.  TikTok will promote your video the more people interact with it.  On the other hand, the internet can be a cruel place.  Perhaps you would rather leave comments off to avoid negative and toxic comments.
6
Allow or disallow people to duet and react to your video.  Duet and React is when other TikTok users use your video to do a side-by-side reaction or duet in their own video.  It's a great way for TikTok artists to collaborate and to comment on other TikTok videos.  Tap the toggle switch next to "Allow duet or react" to allow or disallow other users to duet or react to your video.
7
Allow or disallow people to Stitch your video.  Stitch allows other TikTok users to take a part of your video and use it as part of their own video.  It's another way for users to react to your video and use it as part of their own video.  Tap the toggle switch next to "Allow Stitch" to allow or disallow other users to stitch your video.
8
Save a copy of the video to your smartphone.  By default, TikTok will save a copy of the video you upload to your phone.  If you do not wish to save a copy of the video, tap the toggle switch next to "Save to device".
9
Post your video to Instagram or Snapchat.  Tap the Instagram or Snapchat icon at the bottom to attach the video to a new Instagram or Snapchat post.
10
Tap Post.  It's the pink button at the bottom.  This posts your video to TikTok.
Tips
You will only be able to film up to 60 seconds of music video with TikTok.
Want more effects?  Try filming your videos in Snapchat and uploading them to TikTok.
Many TikTok users like external video editors to edit their TikTok videos before uploading them to TikTok.  This will allow you to use your own music too.
If you want to post a copy of the video to Facebook or Twitter, save a copy to your phone and upload the copy to Facebook or Twitter.
