How to Treat Diarrhea After Drinking Alcohol

Diarrhea, unfortunately, can be one of the many symptoms of a hangover. In general, drinking alcohol causes diarrhea for several reasons, including: it increases the amount of acid in your stomach, which causes irritation and upset; it increases the speed of digestion, which doesn’t give your colon enough time to absorb water; and it changes the bacteria in your gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract. There are many remedies you can try to reduce or eliminate your diarrhea, such as drinking plenty of clear liquids, staying away from high-fat and high-fibre foods, and avoiding caffeine.
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Avoiding Certain Foods and Drinks
1
Stop drinking alcohol. This may seem like an obvious thing to do, but there is an urban myth that implies drinking more alcohol will get rid of a hangover. Technically, this is true. A hangover, including diarrhea, is caused as the alcohol withdraws from your system. If you keep a level of alcohol in your system, some of your hangover symptoms may go away, but only temporarily.
The more alcohol you consume, the more you will damage your GI tract, which can cause long-term, permanent problems.
2
Avoid eating high-fat and high-fibre foods to slow down digestion. Alcohol consumption speeds up the processes in your GI tract, which causes diarrhea. Therefore, when you’re suffering from diarrhea you want to eat foods that will help slow down your digestion and give your GI tract the time it needs to absorb the proper nutrients. Stick to foods that are low in fat and don’t have much fibre.[1]
High-fat foods speed up your digestive processes, which will just exacerbate your diarrhea issues. These types of foods include fried foods, processed meats, chips, fast food like cheeseburgers and fries, and desserts including candy bars.
High-fibre foods increase the amount of water in your stool, which will cause more diarrhea, not less. These types of foods include cereals, whole-grain breads, beans, and whole-grain pastas.
3
Stay away from dairy products while you’re recuperating from a hangover. When dairy products are digested, they produce lactose. Lactose stimulates the muscles in your GI tract and can increase the acid levels in your stomach. A stimulated GI tract and an acidic stomach can cause a lot of gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea. Therefore, it’s a good idea to avoid dairy products until you’re feeling better.[2]
Dairy products to avoid include milk, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt, especially if they're high in fat.
The one exception to this rule is low-fat yogurt with probiotics. This type of yogurt will likely be more beneficial than harmful if you have diarrhea.
Method 2
Method 2 of 3:Adding Beneficial Items to Your Diet
1
Remember to eat ‘BRAT’ foods to help calm your stomach and GI tract. BRAT foods are bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods, plus soda crackers, eggs, and chicken, can all help your GI tract feel better and get rid of your diarrhea. In addition to not irritating your stomach and making you feel sick, these foods will also help keep you hydrated.[3]
Other foods that will help resolve your diarrhea and will keep you hydrated include: soup, pretzels (for the salt), sports drinks, potatoes without the skin, and fruit juices.[4]

Take probiotics to help restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in your GI tract. Alcohol can affect the microflora, or beneficial bacteria, in your digestive system. Not only might it reduce the amount of good bacteria, it may allow for the increase of bad bacteria. Good bacteria is what keeps your digestive system functioning properly, including the elimination of diarrhea. Probiotics are a great option to help you restore the proper balance of bacteria in your digestive system.[5]
Probiotics are available at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Ask your pharmacist for help selecting the best one for you.

Use aromatherapy with peppermint oil to help you feel better. Peppermint oil can relieve gastrointestinal issues, including nausea and diarrhea. Smell the peppermint oil to help calm your stomach. As another option, mix it into a carrier oil and massage it onto your skin.[6]

Massage the diluted peppermint oil onto your stomach to help relieve your stomach issues. As another option, rub it onto your arm and breathe in the scent.

Keep yourself hydrated with lots of clear fluids. Alcohol does a lot of unfortunate things to your body, including decreasing the hormone vasopressin, which causes you to pee a lot more than normal.[7]

Plus, due to the faster processing happening in your GI tract, your colon is having trouble absorbing the proper amount of water you need to keep hydrated. This all means you need to keep up your intake of clear liquids so you do not get dehydrated.[8]

Clear liquids can include water, tea, or broth.
If your hangover has also caused you to vomit and/or feel nauseous, try sucking on ice cubes instead.

Method 3 of 3:Seeking Medical Help
1
Take over-the-counter charcoal tablets for relief if necessary. Charcoal tablets may relieve diarrhea, and they're available over-the-counter at your local drugstore. Read the label and take the charcoal tablets as directed. This may help your diarrhea go away.[9]

Check with your doctor before taking charcoal tablets to make sure they're safe for you.
2
Try over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications if needed. If the non-medicinal options don’t seem to be enough to make you feel better, you may want to consider taking an anti-diarrheal medication. Both brand name and generic versions of these medications are available at your local pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist to determine your best option.[10]
Keep in mind, however, that these medications do not cure diarrhea, they just help improve the symptoms.
Even though these are over-the-counter medications, check with your pharmacist or doctor before taking them to ensure there are no negative interactions with other drugs you may be taking.
3
Seek medical care if you have symptoms of dehydration. Dehydration can be quite serious if you’re not careful. Even with the best intentions, you may find yourself excreting more liquids than you’re able to consume. If you find yourself with the following symptoms, it’s time to seek medical help: lightheadedness, excessive thirst, reduced urination or volume of urine, severe fatigue, dry mouth and/or skin, and dark-coloured urine.[11]

There are several other factors that will increase the possibilities of dehydration, especially if you already have diarrhea, such as: vomiting, very hot and humid weather, significant amounts of exercise, and diabetes.[12]
4
Make an appointment with your doctor if your diarrhea lasts longer than 2 days. Even if you aren’t experiencing the symptoms of dehydration, you’ll want to see your doctor if your diarrhea lasts longer than 48 hours. This is especially important if you have any of the following symptoms: bloody or black stools, intense cramps or pain, and a fever over 102 °F (39 °C).[13]

Diarrhea can also be a side-effect of some medications. Drinking alcohol while taking such medications may make your diarrhea symptoms worse or last longer.
Tips
Individuals with any type of bowel disease, such as Celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s, or colitis are much more susceptible to the negative effects of alcohol. Talk to your doctor about what level of alcohol is safe for you to consume.[14]
If you have 1 of these conditions, it's best that you avoid drinking alcohol.
Warnings
If you or someone you know is abusing alcohol and needs help, you can look for treatment options in both the US and Canada at the Alcoholics Anonymous website: https://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/need-help-with-a-drinking-problem.
