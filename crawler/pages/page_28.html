How to Cut a Bob

Last Updated: September 16, 2021
A bob is a simple hairstyle that is easy to cut and modify. This style is most often used on short, straight hair. But you can have a bob cut if you have long or curly hair, too. As a hairstyle, a bob cut is easy to style and maintain. If you are an ambitious home hair-cutter, you can cut your hair into a basic bob. You should gather the necessary supplies so you can cut the bob properly and then follow a few simple steps to get the bob look.
Part 1
Part 1 of 2:Gathering the Necessary Supplies
1
Get good cutting shears for hair. If you decide to cut your own hair at home, you should look for cutting shears that are made for hair and that are high quality. You can find good cutting shears online or at beauty supply stores. Using good quality shears will make it easier to cut your hair at home.
You should look for cutting shears that have a stainless steel blade and a blade that is sharpened. Do not use kitchen shears, household scissors, or gardening shears as they could pull or damage your hair.

Buy hair clippers and a hair razor. You can find hair clippers online or at a beauty supply store. Get hair clippers that are electric and good quality, as you are going to be using this tool to cut the bob.[1]
A hair razor will also be useful for cutting the bob as it will allow you to shape and trim your hair without having to do any major cutting. Make sure the hair razor is sharp as a dull razor will make it more difficult to use.
You may also want a pair of thinning shears, which will remove volume while creating texture on the ends of your hair.[2]

Get a hair comb and hair ties. You will also need a hair comb and 3 hair ties. You can find these products online or in the beauty aisle of your local drugstore. The hair comb is going to help you create even sections of your hair for the cut. The hair ties will keep sections of hair out of the way as you cut.

Part 2 of 2:Cutting the Bob
1
Confirm the style if someone else is cutting your hair. If you are getting a friend to cut your hair into a bob, you should discuss the steps for the cut beforehand. You should also confirm the length and style you want for your hair before your friend starts cutting away.
During the cut, you should also communicate with your friend and confirm that they are doing what you want with your hair. Let your friend know if the style is too long or if it needs to be tweaked so you end up with a bob you like.
2
Wash and dry your hair. You will need to start with hair that is clean and dry. Use your usual shampoo and conditioner on your hair. Then, allow it to air dry or blow dry it. Having hair that is dry will ensure you do not cut your hair too short, as wet hair can end up drying shorter than it looks.[3]

It’s especially important to dry your hair first if it’s curly or wavy. Curly hair appears much longer when it’s wet.[5]
Before you dry your wet hair, you may want to use the hair comb to find your natural part. Finding your natural part is important if you plan to part your hair to one side, rather than do a middle part.
You can find your natural part by running the comb over the front section of your hair so the hair falls to the back of your hair. Then, use your hand to gently push the hair forward. Your hair should fall toward your natural part.
You can also determine your natural part by noting which side of your head you usually part your hair on. You can then keep this in mind when you are cutting your hair so your hair parts as you like it.

Divide your hair into 3 even sections. Use the comb to divide your hair into 3 even sections: 1 section at the back, and 1 section on either side of your head. Secure the 3 sections using hair ties.[6]
[7]
Make sure the back section sits just above the back of your neck. You will need to be able to gently slide the hair tie up and down your hair at the back, so do not tie it too tightly.
4
Cut the back section off with scissors. You may need to use a hand mirror to see the back ponytail if you are cutting your hair yourself. Move the back ponytail up or down against your neck, based on the length you would like the bob to be. If you want a shorter bob, move the ponytail further up. For a longer bob, move the ponytail further down. Most bobs are on the shorter side, so you may opt for a shorter cut in the back.[8]
[9]
Use the cutting shears to cut right underneath the back ponytail. You may need to cut across the top of the back ponytail slowly to ensure you get an even cut, especially if you have thicker hair.
For a more blunt look, you can use the hair clippers to trim any uneven hairs underneath the back ponytail. If you are using the hair clippers on your own hair, take care to hold the clippers steady as you trim off any uneven hairs. Try to get an even cut all the way across the back ponytail so the back section will appear straight and even.
5
Use the hair razor on the side sections. Release the back ponytail once you are done trimming it. Then, release the side ponytails. You should have a blunt, even cut in the back section and longer side sections. You will then take the hair razor and shape the side sections until they are the length you would like for the bob.[10]
[11]
If you are going for a more A-line look, you may keep the side sections a bit longer than the back section. Lift up small sections of hair and run the hair razor through the bottom of the hair in an angled, upward motion. This will help to trim and shape the hair so it is at an even angle to the back section of your hair.
For more of a straight bob look, use the hair razor to shape and trim the side sections so they are in line with the back section. Run the hair razor through the bottom part of your hair in an upward motion until it is trimmed to the length of the back section.
6
Add layers, if desired. If you would like to add volume to your bob, you may decide to add layers. This is ideal if you have thinner hair, as you may opt for layers so your hair has more body. If you have thicker hair, you may avoid layers so your hair does not appear too puffy or round.
To add layers, use the hair comb to comb out a section of hair on the side of your head, towards the back of your head. Hold the section of hair so the ends are facing upward and use the cutting shears to trim the ends, pointing the scissors down and in as you trim. Do not cut the hair straight across, as this will lead to jagged ends.
Continue to do this on the sides and back of your hair, cutting the ends of the hair with the scissors pointed down and in. This will create layers throughout your hair, giving your bob a more voluminous look.
7
Blend the ends of the hair. As a finishing touch, you should blend the ends of your hair so your bob looks even and polished. Blending the ends will also help to remove any stray pieces of hair that are too long.[12]
[13]
Lift up small pieces of hair and run the hair razor on the ends of the hair in a downward, angled motion. This will help to taper the ends and make them appear more blended. Do this around your entire head so the ends are blended.
You might find it helpful to spritz your hair with a spray bottle to dampen it slightly as you cut, especially if your hair is straight. This will help you achieve cleaner, more even lines as you tidy up your bob.[14]
If you want a softer, textured bob, use thinning shears on the bottom 1 in (2.5 cm) of your hair, rather than a razor.[15]

Tips
Consider allowing a professional to create the style and then keeping it trimmed yourself at home. There are many variations to the basic bob cut, and a professional can advise you about which works best with your face shape and hair type.
Keep in mind that a short bob cut will need to be trimmed more frequently than long hair if you want to maintain the look! You may need a trim every 4-6 weeks.[16]
