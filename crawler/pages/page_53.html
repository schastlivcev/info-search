Sliding glass doors can become difficult to open because the track accumulates dirt and debris. The steps below tell you how to keep your sliding glass door sliding smoothly.
Method 1
Method 1 of 2:The Thorough Way
Use this method at least once a year to thoroughly clean and lubricate the track to your sliding door. If you have a screen door, remove it first—–it will easily lift up and out of the track.
1
Remove drapes, blinds or any other window furnishings from your door.
2
Grasp each end of the door. Push the door up so that the wheels on the bottom of the door clear the track. You may have to use a screwdriver to loosen the level screws for the bottom wheels in order to get them to clear the bottom threshold.[1]
3
Keep pushing the door upward. Pull it towards you at the same time until it clears the door opening.[2]
4
Place the door on two sawhorses so that you can clean the track wheels.
5
Use a wire brush to loosen the hair and dirt from the wheels.
6
Vacuum the debris from the wheels and the entire bottom and top of the door.
7
Apply a non-stick silicone lubricant to the wheels.
8
Test the rollers to be sure that they are clear of all debris and are moving freely.
9
Vacuum the door track.
10
Wipe out the door track with a wet rag.
11
Apply some of the lubricant to the tracks in the door opening before you replace the door.
12
Lift the door from the sawhorses. Position the top of the door inside the top track of the door opening.
13
Push the door up so that the bottom rollers clear the bottom threshold.
14
Let the rollers drop into the bottom track. If you have loosened any screws, retighten them once the door is completely back in its track to make sure the door is plumb.
15
Slide the door back and forth until it is sliding smoothly.
Method 2
Method 2 of 2:The Quick Way
If the track to your sliding door isn’t too gummed up with dirt and grime, you can get your door sliding smoothly again in about 15 minutes.
1
Thoroughly vacuum the track to your door while it is still closed.
2
Slide the door all the way open so that you can access the other side of the track.
3
Scrape out the dirt and debris from the track using a flat blade screwdriver.
4
Vacuum the loosened dirt using an attachment with a narrow tip.
5
Use an old rag to apply generous amounts of a non-stick lubricant to both tracks of the sliding door.[3]
6
Slide the door open and shut several times so that the entire track gets lubricated. You may have to open and shut the door for several minutes before it slides smoothly.
Tips
It also helps to lubricate the tracks to your sliding doors every few months.
Be sure to clean the tracks on both sides of the door.
Clean the track to your sliding door every few months with a wire brush. The brush will loosen stubborn dirt deposits, which you can then vacuum.
Warnings
It’s best to have a helper if you are going to remove your door from its tracks. If you should have to loosen screws, your helper can spot you and make sure the door doesn’t fall before you can remove it.
Try to avoid oily lubricants because they attract dirt and dust; you’ll have to clean the rollers and tracks of your doors much more often if you use any kind of grease or oil instead of a non-stick lubricant.
