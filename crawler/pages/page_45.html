Last Updated: May 6, 2021
Congratulations, you’re in college! If you feel anxious at all about college life, know that you are not alone. To gain instant respect from your fellow classmates and friends, remember to always be yourself. Being friendly and acting confidently are also ways you can earn some cool points among your friends and classmates.
Method 1
Method 1 of 4:Reinventing Yourself in College
1
List the things you want to change about yourself. Grab a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle. List the things that you would like to change about yourself in the left column. In the right column write down why you would like to change these things. If after asking why you see that making these changes leads to a better you, then change it.[1]
For example, wanting to be less critical of others, or more focused in class are positive changes.
2
Try something new. College is all about exploring new things and ideas, so be adventurous. When you get the invite to go eat at an exotic restaurant, take it. Studying abroad for one year is another great way to expand your horizons.
Try changing your hair color, or style your hair differently.
You could also learn a new language, or take a class outside of your major.
3
Remember to be yourself. It is possible to re-invent yourself without changing your true self. Don't throw out your morals and values just to be considered cool. If the change takes too much effort or requires you to be someone else, then it probably isn't a good change. Stick to changes that produce positive results.[2]
If you want to be more outgoing, then be more outgoing on your own terms. Don't start drinking or smoking just to be more outgoing, for example.
Method 2
Method 2 of 4:Boosting Your Confidence
1
Make a list of your strengths. Also make a list of the things that you like about yourself. Tape the list to your bedroom wall or bathroom mirror. Every morning, read the list to remind yourself of how great you are.
2
Reverse negative thoughts. If you find yourself thinking that you aren't good enough for college or that no one will want to be friends with you, then reverse these thoughts. Instead, tell yourself, "I am good enough for college," or "Many people would love to be friends with me because I am a great friend."[3]
3
Do the things that make you feel confident. If wearing makeup helps you feel more confident, then wear makeup. If smiling and greeting your classmates makes you feel more confident, then greet them. If joining a club or volunteering helps you feel more confident, then join a club or volunteer.[4]
By doing the things that help you feel more confident, you will be more confident.
4
Realize that you are not alone. New people and places can make you feel alone and unsure at times. However, understand that you aren't the only one who feels this way. Try to reach out and befriend other classmates, or call your high school friends if you need someone to talk to.[5]
If you cannot seem to shake your loneliness, make an appointment with a counselor on campus. A counselor can help you work through hard times.
Method 3
Method 3 of 4:Being Social
1
Portray a friendly attitude. Smile and say hi to your classmates sitting next you. Strike up a conversation by asking them what their major is or what they think about the class. Offering help, like showing someone where the admissions office is, is also a great way to become known as a friendly, down-to-earth person in college.[6]
You could also offer to trade notes with someone, or help someone study for a big test.
2
Be accepting those who are different from you. A typical college has at least 20,000 students, (smaller colleges and community colleges might have anywhere from 2,000-10,000 students) so you are bound to run into someone whose background is completely different from yours. Instead of shying away from them, be curious about who they are. Invite them to lunch or a party to get to know them better.
3
Attend a football game (or any other sporting event). Tailgating with friends and attending a football game (or any other sporting event) afterward is a college pastime you won’t want to pass up. Go to as many of these as you can, especially if you enjoy them. It is a great way to connect with new people and cultivate friendships.[7]
Ask a classmate if they would like to go to a game, or make plans with your roommate to attend a game.
4
Join a club on campus. If football games or Greek life isn’t your thing, try looking into different clubs on campus. Like sororities and fraternities, they typically host events in the beginning of the year to recruit new members. Attend some of these and join your favorite ones.
There are so many clubs in college, the hardest part will be picking one. You can also start a club as well.
5
Host a party. Hosting a party will definitely shoot you up to the top of the cool list. Have a potluck, plan an outdoor party at a nearby park, or reserve a party room at your college’s game center. Invite your friends, roommates, and acquaintances from class.[8]
You could also have a small party in your dorm room, if it is allowed.
To ensure your party’s success, make sure to provide some snacks and beverages, cool tunes, and games.
Method 4
Method 4 of 4:Dressing for College
1
Put yourself together before class. Before going to class, make sure to brush your teeth and comb your hair. Also shower if you need to. By taking the time to groom yourself before class, you can give your classmates and professors a good impression of yourself.[9]
2
Choose sneakers over heels. Going from class to class requires a lot of walking. By wearing sneakers, you can ensure that your feet will be as comfortable as possible. [10]
. Some classes will require you to wear certain footwear for practical or safety reasons, especially if you are in some hands-on classes or a PE class.  Your instructor/professor will inform you in the syllabus.
3
Carry a jacket with you.  Unlike high school, colleges usually don't have locker areas so you will be wearing or carrying a jacket during the winter season in colder climates. Classroom temperatures typically run very cold to sometimes very hot. Since it is hard to concentrate in class if you are cold, make sure to bring a jacket or a sweater with you. This way you can ensure that you will be comfortable and attentive in class.[11]
.  People will be paying more attention to your outerwear as part of your look in college than in high school; so, make sure the outerwear you choose matches your preferred look.
4
Dress with style. Arrive to class in an outfit that makes you feel comfortable, but also one that sends a message of sophistication and style. If casual athletic gear is your style, then wear that. If a cute dress or skirt makes you feel confident, then wear it.[12]
