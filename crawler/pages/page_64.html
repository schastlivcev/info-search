Method 6 of 6:Advanced Tips
1
Get recording software. Recording software allows you to have more editing and production capabilities and can help make a sharper, higher quality podcast. You’ll be able to record directly onto the computer, add other audio files, and edit.
There are free audio recording and editing platforms like Audacity that work well for most beginners.
For high end audio production, consider investing in software like Pro Tools.
2
Buy recording equipment. The basics would include: microphones, a mixer, and headphones. This equipment tied with recording software will ensure a high sound quality and enhance your recording experience.
Look for usb microphones that plug directly into your computer.
Have enough microphones to support your cast and any guests that would come on.
A mixer can provide greater control over individual audio channels and audio effects.
Headphones are important when you incorporate a mixer so that you can listen to adjustments that the mixer will make.
A pop filter can help reduce audio pops that can occur when consonants are punctuated loudly.
Make sure your recording equipment are all compatible to work together.
3
Edit your podcast. Editing is a post production activity; listening to your podcast through an audio editing software and altering different aspects as you go.
Ensure your podcast hits a certain time length, removing any slow or unnecessary parts or adding related audio from other sources.
Ensure audio levels channels are all at the right volumes throughout the recording.
Add miscellaneous sound effects and/or background music.
Warnings
Make sure everything in your podcast is either your own material or copyright-free. This includes any music you decide to play.
