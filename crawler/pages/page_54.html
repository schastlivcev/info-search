Although protein is an essential part of a healthy diet, eating more of it will not help you lose weight or build muscle. Eating too much protein can lead to weight gain, bad breath, and digestive issues. Getting too much protein can also lead to low bone density by causing you to excrete calcium in your urine, and too much protein may lead to a 250% increase in your risk of kidney stones.[1]

You can avoid consuming too much protein by focusing on other types of foods, determining your protein needs, and choosing protein from the right sources. It will also help if you learn which foods contain a lot of protein and which are low in protein.
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Determining Your Needs
1
Figure out how much protein you need. If you want to avoid eating too much protein, you need to establish how much protein you need. In the US, individuals are encouraged to consume 10-35% of their calories from protein. This amount can vary based on your current weight, activity level, and fitness goals. For instance, if you are a 33 year old, 5’4” tall women who weighs 150 lbs. with a moderate daily activity level, you should aim to consume 1850 calories each day to maintain your current weight. Between 185 and 650 of these calories should come from protein (46-162 grams).[2]

An easy way to calculate your protein needs is to multiply your weight in kilograms by 0.8 (divide your weight in pounds by 2.2 to get your weight in kilograms). For example, if you weigh 70 kilograms, then your daily protein needs would be 56 grams (70 x 0.8 = 56).
Keep in mind that optimal protein intake is 1 gram per kilogram, so you would want to aim for between 56 to 70 grams if you weigh 70 kilograms. Older adults also need more protein, so you could have as much as 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight if you are over 50 years old.[3]
Numerous online protein calculators can help give you a personalized “protein number” to shoot for.
Eat slightly more protein if you are trying to lose weight and/or build muscle.
Eat slightly more protein if you exercise regularly and live an active lifestyle.

Keep a log of what you eat. Once you know how much protein you need, you need to compare this against the amount of protein you normally eat. Without altering your diet, keep a food log for at least a week. Be sure to include portion sizes. Go back and total up the amount of protein you consumed. You can easily find the protein amounts for specific foods by performing an internet search. Here is a brief guide:[4]
3 ounce piece of meat – 21 grams.
8 ounce piece of meat – up to 50 grams.
8 ounces of milk – 8 grams.
8 ounces of yogurt – 11 grams.
8 ounces of dry beans – 16 grams.

Consult a professional. In order to determine your own personalized protein needs, it is best to consult a professional nutritionist. A nutritionist will be able to weigh a variety of personalized factors and help you draft a specific meal plan for you to follow. Additionally, before making any major changes to your diet or lifestyle, you should consult your doctor.[5]

Method 2 of 3:Eating a Balanced Diet
1
Snack on fruit. If you have found that you have too much protein in your diet, you need to make some changes. You can reduce the protein in your diet back to a normal level, by filling that space alternative healthy foods. Instead of grabbing for that protein bar, snack on a piece of fruit.[7]
You can try:
1 medium apple – 0.5 grams protein.
1 cup grapes – 0.6 grams protein.
1 cup blueberries – 1.1 grams protein.
1 medium banana – 1.3 grams protein.
1 kiwi – 0.8 grams protein.
1 cup cantaloupe – 1.3 grams protein.
2
Munch on veggies. Vegetables should take up the most room on your plate. Veggies are full of vitamins and mineral that are essential to a healthy diet. Choose a smaller serving of protein, and fill that space with health-supportive vegetables.[8]
Toss mixed veggies in olive oil and roast them in the oven – 2 grams protein per ½ cup.
Choose a green salad for lunch – average 5 grams protein per bowl.
Snack on raw veggies, like carrots, celery, or chopped bell pepper – 3 grams protein per 2 cups.
3
Include some whole grains. Although some modern weight loss fads may have said differently, complex carbohydrates are your friend. Whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Plus, they give you energy![9]
Try eating brown rice (5 grams protein per cup) or quinoa (13.1 grams protein per cup) with meals.
Grab a rice cake for a quick snack (1 gram protein per rice cake).
If you eat pasta or bread, choose whole grain options (7 grams of protein per 1 cup cooked pasta).

Make sure you’re eating healthy fats. The final ingredient in a healthy balanced diet is the inclusion of healthy fats. That’s right: not all fat is bad for you. Healthy fats build your brain and help your body run. Oils contain very little protein. Some good healthy fat choices include:[10]

Method 3 of 3:Choosing the Right Protein Sources
1
Avoid processed meat. Alongside eating the right amount of protein, you must ensure that you’re getting the right type of protein. Overly-processed sources of protein can be high in preservatives, additives, and antibiotics, which do not make good fuel for your body. Skip the processed stuff when you can. Avoid:[11]
