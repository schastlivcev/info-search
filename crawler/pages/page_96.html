Being accused, suspected, or charged with a sex crime is an incredibly serious situation. If you or someone you know has found themselves in this situation, it is important to hire a qualified attorney right away. As soon as you know of an accusation, you should begin your search for an attorney specializing in sex crime defense. Interview your top choices and choose the attorney that you feel can help you successfully defend any criminal charges. If you are facing a civil lawsuit on top of any criminal charges, be sure you find a suitable civil attorney in addition to your criminal attorney.

Part 1 of 3:Conducting Your Search
1
Hire an attorney as soon as possible. If you have been accused, suspected, or charged with a sex crime, you need to contact an attorney as soon as possible. Sex crimes are incredibly serious offenses that may lead to imprisonment and a life on the sex offender registry.
Do not talk to police or investigators until you have hired an attorney or have had one appointed to you.
Do not wait to hire an attorney until you are formally charged. It is important to hire a qualified attorney at the earliest possible stages.[1]
2
Look for a civil attorney if necessary. Apart from any criminal investigation or charges you may face, there is also a possibility that the alleged victim will sue you in civil court for money damages as well. This is common in cases of sexual assault. If you find yourself in this situation, you will need to find a civil attorney who handles cases stemming from sexual assault allegations. Criminal attorneys will usually not be equipped to handle civil cases, and vice versa, so you will likely have to hire separate attorneys for each phase.
3
Get a referral. If you have used an attorney's services in the past, live next to an attorney, or work with one, do not hesitate to ask them for a referral.[2]
The legal community is relatively small and most lawyers have a network of other lawyers that work in every field. If you talk to an attorney, ask if they can get you in contact with someone specializing in sex crime defense or sexual assault civil cases.
Referrals are often the easiest and best way to find a highly qualified attorney. In general, if other lawyers are recommending someone, chances are they are good at what they do.
4
Ask family and friends for recommendations. If you do not know any attorneys, talk to your family and friends and ask if they know anyone. Talking to friends and family about these sensitive issues can often be difficult but hopefully they will be able to help you. If you do not feel comfortable discussing this subject with friends and family, simply ask if they could recommend a criminal defense attorney. If they know one, you can talk with that attorney about someone else who may specialize in sex crimes and related civil cases.
5
Search for specialized lawyers. Many states offer specialization programs that allow attorneys to be recognized as experts in a certain legal field. For example, in California, lawyers can become State Bar certified in criminal law when they pass a written test and demonstrate a high level of experience.[3]
Even if your state does not offer specialization programs, some attorneys may hold themselves out as focusing on certain areas of the law. With this in mind, ask any attorney you talk with if they have handled sex crime cases or if they know someone who does.
It is especially important to find a focused attorney when your issue is related to a sex crime. The prosecution and defense of sex crimes is unique in many ways and requires someone with specialized knowledge. Due to the public's perception of the accused, the requirement of having to cross-examine children, and the troubles of finding an impartial jury, you need to find someone who has dealt with these issues before.[4]

Check with your state bar website. Most states offer certified lawyer referral services through their state bar website. Check with your state bar and ask about their referral programs. For example, in California, the State Bar will interview you and then put you in contact with an attorney that can help you.
State bar referral services are a great and safe way to find a competent attorney because of the standards they hold themselves to. For example, in California, the California Supreme Court requires these services to meet certain standards. If you feel like those standards have not been met, you can file a complaint with the California Bar and they will look into it.[6]

Visit attorney websites. While many attorneys choose not to advertise their services, a growing number have turned to the internet. Do a quick internet search for "sex crime defense attorneys" in your location and see what comes up. Visit some of the websites you find and analyze what you see. An attorney's website should be clean and straightforward. In addition, it should contain the lawyer's name, background, and specialties. Oftentimes the websites will even have some general information about the laws they most often deal with.
8
Check bar records. Once you have a list of candidates, go to your state bar's website and check each attorney's record of discipline. Every state has the ability to discipline attorneys for actions deemed to be immoral, untruthful, or criminal. If the attorney has been publicly reprimanded, there will be a record of it on their bar profile. If an attorney on your list has been in trouble and has a record of discipline, you should seriously consider taking them off your list.
For example, in California, you can look up an attorney by their name or bar number. Once you do, their personal information will pop up and it will include any history of discipline.[7]
9
Research candidates online. In addition to checking your state bar's website, check other online services for client reviews. These services, including Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com, and others will provide valuable information about the lawyer, which may include feedback from past clients. Read each lawyer's reviews but be aware that there are many reasons for both positive and negative reviews.
For example, a positive review may come from a friend who is simply trying to boost their buddy's business. On the other side, a negative review may come from a client who lost their case for reasons out of the attorney's control. Take each review seriously but be aware of possible flaws.

Part 2 of 3:Interviewing Your Top Choices
1
Make appointments. Once you have narrowed your list to around three to five top choices, you should contact those attorneys and make appointments to meet with them. Nothing substitutes for meeting an attorney face-to-face and talking through your case with them. Call or email each attorney and ask to set up a convenient time to come in. These meetings, often called initial consultations, may cost money. Be sure you ask about any fees ahead of time so you are not surprised when you get there. Do not be shy about asking if they will waive any fee for the initial meeting.
2
Research and prepare for each appointment. Once you have your consultations scheduled, you need to take the time and prepare. Start by gathering every document and piece of information you have regarding your situation. Common types of documents might include police reports, charging statements, and witness statements.
In addition, research common questions to ask attorneys during your first meeting. Know the facts of your case and be ready to give each attorney a quick summary of what you believe happened. Bring the names, addresses, and phone numbers of anyone who is involved in the case.[8]
The more prepared you are the more you will get out of each appointment.
If you are hiring a civil attorney, you will want to gather documents including any notice you have been served with, any lawsuit that has been filed against you, and any response you may have already given.
3
Ask questions. When you attend the meeting, which will usually last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, ask as many questions about the lawyer as you feel are necessary. In general, you should ask some, if not all, the following questions:
What is your experience handling similar cases as yours?
What are your chances of success?
How long have you practiced in this state?
What types of motions have you litigated in sex crime cases?
How much trial experience do you have with sex crime cases?
Do you have relationships with the local authorities?
Do you have ample legal staff?
What experts do you work with?
Do you work with an independent investigator?[9]
4
Observe the attorney. When the attorney is answering your questions and giving you their opinion, see how the attorney reacts and gauge their confidence in your case. Feel free to take notes during the meeting as well. This will help you remember everything they said and will help you compare each attorney's answers to your questions. When you are observing the attorney, you want to see confidence, knowledge, kindness, and compassion. You want to feel like the attorney knows the law and can successfully apply it your case.
If the attorney seems confused, nervous, or aloof, consider crossing them off the list.
5
Compare your candidates. After you have sat down with each attorney on your short list, take the time to compare your candidates again. Read over your notes and see who answered your questions in a way that impressed you. If you have follow-up questions you should not hesitate to call the attorney and ask them.

Part 3 of 3:Choosing Your Attorney
1
Consider fees. While the most important consideration in choosing an attorney is their ability to successfully handle your case, you must also consider the amount of money it will cost you to have that done. When you have narrowed your list to the top couple of candidates, compare their fees. If you feel confident in both attorneys, choose the one that will cost less. Before making your decision, make sure you understand how different fee arrangements work.
Fixed fees are one time fees you pay a lawyer to complete a certain task. In sex crime cases, these fees will usually be broken up into time periods.For example, you may pay separate fees for arraignments, probable cause hearings, pre-trial work, and the trial. If the case settles, the attorney might pocket the your fee, even if some of it was unused.
Hourly fees are, just as they sound, payments based on the number of hours the attorney works on your case. A lot of criminal defense attorneys will have hourly fees. Make sure you ask what their hourly rate is and how many hours they expect to bill for.
A retainer fee, in this type of situation, will often mean a sort of down payment. Some criminal defense lawyers will ask for a fee up front in order to get started. All of your legal fees will be subtracted from your down payment until it is used up.
Attorneys may accept property in addition to cash. When an attorney accepts to represent you, they will want to ensure they will get paid and that often means taking payment in whatever form they can get. Often, if you do not have enough cash on hand or the financial resources to pay your bills, your attorney may place liens on property you own.
In any fee arrangement, be sure you understand what extra out-of-pocket costs you will incur. These will often include court fees, filing fees, witness fees, copying and faxing costs, and travel expenses.[10]
2
Go with your first impression. First impressions are often the right impressions and you should go with your gut when choosing an attorney. At the end of the day, you are going to be spending a lot of time with the person you hire and they are going to be responsible for your freedom and well-being. Choose someone who makes you feel comfortable and who you believe in.
3
Let your first choice know as soon as possible. When you make your choice, call the attorney and let them know right away. Attorneys are busy people and you want to make sure they will still be able to take your case. After you inform the attorney that you want to hire them, they will likely want to sit down with you again to fill out some paperwork and get things started.
4
Get your agreement in writing. When you meet with your attorney for the first time after hiring them, you want to make sure you get your representation agreement, which includes a fee agreement, in writing. Your agreement will include the scope of the representation and what their fee will be. This way, both you and the attorney will know what to expect from each other.[11]
