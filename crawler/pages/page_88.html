Last Updated: November 5, 2020
Removing a door panel from a car may seem like a difficult thing to do, but it’s actually quite simple. Start by removing the control panel and door latch with a screwdriver and disconnecting their electrical wires. Then take off the rest of the trim pieces that may be concealing the panel’s fastening screws and use a screwdriver to take out all of the screws holding the panel in place. Take a firm hold of the panel, and pull it straight off. It’s that easy!
Part 1
Part 1 of 3:Removing the Control Panel and Door Latch
1
Lift the door latch and remove the screw attaching it to the panel. Hold the door handle latch open and look for a fastening screw at the base of the latch. Take a screwdriver and remove the screw. Set the screw aside so you don’t lose it.[1]
You may need to hold the latch open in order to access the fastening screw.
2
Use a pair of pliers to pull the door latch off of the panel. The door latch is also held in place by small plastic clips that can make it difficult to remove by hand. Use a pair of pliers to get a good grip on the latch and then gently, but firmly pull the latch away from the panel.[2]
Don’t yank or twist the latch or you could damage the connecting clips.
Be careful not to squeeze the latch too hard with the pliers or you could crack or crush it.
3
Wedge a screwdriver into the lower edge of the control panel and pry it up. Most modern cars have a panel on the door that controls the windows and door lock. Take a flathead screwdriver and wedge it into the lower edge of the control panel, where it connects to the door panel. Use gentle pressure to pry it up and pop it out of place.[3]
The control panel is held in place by small connecting clips that can be easily damaged if you snap or jerk the screwdriver to remove it.
Tip: If you’re having trouble prying up the control panel, wedge the screwdriver into the side and then the top of the panel to disconnect the small connector clips holding it in place. Once all of the clips are disconnected, the control panel will slide right out.
4
Disconnect the wires from the control panel to remove it. Locate the plugs on the backside of the panel. Take a firm grip on the plug and gently wiggle it as you pull it off. Remove any plugs attached to the panel.[4]
Some plugs may have clips that you need to press while you pull them to remove them.
Don’t try to force or yank on the plugs or you could damage them.
5
Remove the clip wire and pull off the window crank if there is one. Some cars may have a manual window crank that needs to be removed. Take a metal pick tool and wedge it behind the crank. Locate the small clip wire holding it in place and slide it out from behind the crank. Then, pull the crank straight out with your hands to remove it.[5]
There may also be a plastic washer behind the crank, so make sure you don’t lose it when you pull it off if you plan to reassemble the door panel later.

Part 2 of 3:Taking off the Trim Pieces
1
Insert a screwdriver into the edge of the armrest cover and pry it off. The armrest cover may be concealing a fastening screw. Take a flathead screwdriver and wedge it into the crack at the edge of the panel. Apply gentle pressure to pop it out and remove it.[6]
Don’t snap the armrest cover or you could crack it or damage the clips holding it in place.
Tip: If you hear creaking or cracking sounds, stop applying pressure and move the screwdriver to a different location on the cover so you don’t crack or break it.
2
Pry off the cover at the edge of the window with a screwdriver. Look for a small, triangular cover piece at the top edge of the door panel, where the window connects to it. Wedge your fingers into the edge of the cover piece and gently pull against it to remove it.[7]
If you can’t get the cover off with your hands, wedge a screwdriver into the edge of it and pry it off.
3
Remove the speaker cover and screws and pull it off if there is one. Remove off the speaker cover by wedging a screwdriver into the edge of it and prying it off. Then, remove any screws holding the speaker in place. Pull the speaker out of the door panel and unplug any wires connected to it.[8]
The wire harness may require you to pinch or hold the clip holding it in place.
Speakers can be damaged easily so don’t drop it or yank it from the door panel.

Part 3 of 3:Pulling the Door Panel Off
1
Pry off any screw covers from the door panel with a screwdriver. Look for small, round plastic pieces that are the same color as your door panel, wedge a flathead screwdriver into them, and pry them off to expose the fastening screws beneath them. Check behind the door latch, beneath the control panel, and on the sides of the door panel.[9]
Fastening screws can be installed in a variety of locations depending on your car door, so be sure to look all around for the covers that conceal them.
2
Remove the fastening screws from the panel. Use a screwdriver to take out all of the fastening screws from the door panel. Some panel screws may be plastic and can simply be pulled out of place with a pair of pliers.[10]
Tip: Many door panels are held on by specialized screws that can be difficult to replace. Keep the screws together in separate, labeled bags so they’re organized and you don’t lose them if you plan to reassemble the door later on.
3
Grab the door panel at the top and bottom and wiggle it. Use your hands to take a firm grip on the door panel with your hands by holding it at the top and bottom. Make sure that all of the fastening screws have been removed by giving the panel a good shake to see if it’s loose enough to pull off.[11]
If there are any spots that won’t wiggle, there may be a fastening screw that you missed.
Gently wiggling the panel will loosen the connecting clips, making it easier to remove.
4
Pull the door panel straight out with your hands to remove it. Disconnect the small, plastic connector clips holding the door panel in place by pulling the door panel straight out using 1 swift motion. The clips will unsnap and the panel will come right off.[12]
Don’t pull at an upward or downward angle or the clips won’t release the panel.
Avoid using multiple, jerky motions. If the panel is difficult to remove, check that you’ve removed all of the fastening screws and trim pieces that may be holding it in place.
