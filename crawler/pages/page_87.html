How to Make Smores in the Oven

Last Updated: May 31, 2020
S'mores are a popular campfire treat, but you don't have to wait until your next camping trip in order to make one. One of the easiest ways to make s'mores is using your oven. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make several s'mores at once. If you are impatient, you can use a broiler instead. If you don't have an oven, you can use a toaster oven instead!
Ingredients
Graham crackers
Plain milk chocolate bars
Marshmallow
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Using an Oven
1
Preheat your oven to 400 °F (204 °C).[1]
2
Break some graham crackers in half. Place half of the broken crackers on a baking sheet, leaving some space between each one. Save the rest for later. How many graham crackers you break depends on how many s'mores you want to make. One graham cracker is enough to make one s'more.
3
Top each graham cracker half with a marshmallow. Place the marshmallow flat-side-down on top of the cracker so that it doesn't roll off.
4
Bake the s'mores for 3 to 5 minutes. They are ready when the marshmallows turn puffy and golden-brown.[2]
5
Place a piece of plain chocolate on top of each s'more. The best type of chocolate to use for s'mores is the kind that you can break into smaller bars. You should be able to fit 2 to 4 squares on each s'more.
6
Top each s'more with a graham cracker half. Gently press down on the cracker to create a seal.[3]
7
Wait 1 minute before digging in. This will give the chocolate time to soften up and turn gooey. It will also allow the marshmallow cool down a little.[4]

Method 2
Method 2 of 3:Using a Broiler
1
Preheat the broiler on your oven. Make sure that the rack is in the upper third of the oven.[5]
Broiling is different from regular baking in that the heat comes from the top of the oven. Your s'mores will also be ready much faster.[6]
2
Break some graham crackers in half. Place half of the broken graham crackers on a baking sheet, leaving a few inches/centimeters of space between each one. Set the rest aside for later. How many crackers you break depends on how many s'mores you want to eat. One graham cracker is enough to make one s'more.
3
Place a marshmallow on each graham cracker half. Make sure that you set them flat-side-down so that they  don't roll off.
4
Bake the s'mores for 45 to 75 seconds. Keep the oven door cracked open and watch the marshmallows closely; things brown quickly in a broiler! They are ready when the marshmallows turn golden-brown.[7]
5
Top each s'more with some plain chocolate. The best type of chocolate to use for s'mores are the type that you can break into smaller squares. You should be able to fit 2 to 4 squares on each s'more.
6
Top each s'more with another graham cracker half. Press down gently on the s'more to help seal everything together.
7
Let the s'mores rest for 1 minute before eating them. This gives the chocolate enough time to soften up and turn gooey.[8]
It will also allow the marshmallows to cool down a little.

Method 3
Method 3 of 3:Using a Toaster Oven
1
Set your toaster oven to a medium "toast" setting.[9]
If your toaster's tray is not covered with foil, it might be a good idea to cover it with some aluminum foil now. This will make cleaning up easier.
2
Break some graham crackers in half. How many you break depends on how many s'mores you want to make. One graham cracker is enough to make one s'more.
3
Place one of the graham cracker halves on the toaster tray. Set the other graham cracker half aside for later. Depending on the size of your toaster oven, you may be able to make two s'mores at one time--just remember to leave some space between each cracker.
4
Place a marshmallow on top of the graham cracker. Set it flat-side-down so that it does not roll off.
5
Toast the s'more. Slide the tray into the toaster oven and shut the door. Allow the s'more to bake until the marshmallow turns a golden-brown color. This will take about 4 minutes.[10]
6
Top the s'more with a piece of chocolate. Once the marshmallow is toasted, take the s'more out of the toaster oven. Top it off with 2 to 4 squares of plain chocolate.
7
Press the other graham cracker half down on top. Press down on the cracker enough to seal everything together but not so much that the cracker breaks.
8
Let the s'more rest for a moment before eating it. After about 1 minute, the chocolate will have softened to a gooey consistency. The marshmallow will also have cooled down enough to eat.
9
Finished.

Tips
If you don't have any graham crackers, you can use other types of honey-cinnamon crackers instead.
You can bake the chocolate with the marshmallow. Set it down onto the graham cracker before you add the marshmallow.
Add some goodies to the s'mores, such as a raspberry or a banana slice.[11]
Try it with other flavors of graham cracker, such as chocolate.
Try it with caramel or peanut butter-filled chocolate candy.[12]
If you can't find any marshmallows, you can try using marshmallow spread instead; you may have to adjust the baking time, however.
If you can't find any chocolate bars, spread some chocolate-hazelnut spread (ie: Nutella) on one of the graham cracker halves instead.
Warnings
Do not leave the oven unattended, especially when broiling the marshmallows. Marshmallows can burn quickly in an oven.
Be careful when biting into your s'more. The marshmallow filling will be hot.
