How to Upload a Video on Facebook
wikiHow Staff
Last Updated: April 8, 2021
Uploading a video on Facebook is a great way to share your favorite personal moments or just your new favorite video with a variety of your friends. You can upload videos using the Facebook desktop website or the mobile app. Videos are added as posts, but you can limit the audience if you want to keep it private. It is not possible to upload videos using the Facebook mobile site.
Method 1
Method 1 of 3:Using the Facebook Mobile App
1
Tap "What's on your mind?" to start a new post. All Facebook videos are added as posts. You'll need to start a new post to add your video.
2
Tap the "Camera" button at the bottom of the post field. This will open your recent pictures.
If you're doing this for the first time, you'll be prompted to allow Facebook to access your device's camera and storage.
3
Tap the video that you want to upload. You can select multiple videos if you have multiple videos to upload at once. Tap "Done" to add the selected video(s) to your post. You'll see a preview taking up the bulk of your new post.
4
Record a new video to upload to Facebook. You can record a new video now instead of selecting one you've already recorded. The process is a little different for iOS and Android:
iOS - Tap the Camera button in your Facebook post, then tap the Camera again in the top-left corner of your Camera Roll. Tap the Video Camera button in the lower-right corner, then tap the Shutter button to record. Once you're finished recording, tap "Use" to add it to your post.
Tap the Camera button in your post, then tap the Video Camera button with a "+" at the top of the screen. This will open your Android device's camera to record a new video. Once you finish recording, it will be added to the list of videos that you can select.
5
Add information to the video. You can type some text to accompany the video post to add context and help the viewer know what they're seeing.
6
Set the audience for your post. Tap the audience menu at the top to select who will be able to view your uploaded video. If you want to keep the video private, select "Only Me." The video will still be posted to your timeline, but you will be the only one who can see it.
7
Tap "Post" to upload the video. Once you're satisfied with the post, tap "Post" to begin uploading the video. This may take a while for longer videos.
You may want to connect to a wireless network before uploading to avoid using up your data plan.
Method 2
Method 2 of 3:Using the Facebook Website
1
Click the "Photos" option in the menu on the left. You can find "Photos" in the Apps section of the menu.
Make sure you're using the desktop version of the website. It is not possible to upload videos from the Facebook mobile website. If you're on a mobile device and want to upload a video to Facebook, you'll need to use the mobile app.
2
Click the "Add Video" button. This will open the video uploader.
3
Browse for the video file by clicking "Choose File." A file browser will open and you can find the video file you want to upload from your computer. Facebook accepts virtually all common video formats, including mp4, mov, mkv, avi, and wmv.[1]
Length is limited to 120 minutes and file size is limited to 4 GB.[2]
4
Add a title, description, and location. You can add this information using the fields below the file. These fields are optional, but can help other users find and understand your video.
5
Select your audience. Click the drop-down menu next to the "Post" button to select who can view the video. If you only want the video to be viewable by you, select "Only Me." It will still be posted to your timeline, but only you will be able to see it.
6
Click "Post" and wait for your video to upload. After uploading, your video will be viewable by the audience you selected.
All videos that you upload to Facebook are posted to the News Feed. There is no way to upload a video without "posting" it, even if the audience is just set to yourself.
Long videos will take a while to upload and even longer to process. Make sure you have a strong connection before uploading large video files.
7
Find your video in the Photos section of Facebook. You can find all of your uploaded videos by opening the "Photos" app from the menu on the left.
Click the "Albums" tab and then select the "Videos" album to see all of your uploaded videos.
Method 3
Method 3 of 3:Troubleshooting
1
Make sure your video fits the size requirements. Facebook allows videos up to 4 GB in size and up to 120 minutes in length. Make sure your video meets these requirements if you aren't able to upload it.
2
Make sure the video is the proper format. Facebook accepts most common video formats, including AVI, MOV, MP4, and MKV. If your video is not in one of the accepted formats, you won't be able to upload it. Converting the video to an allowed format will allow you to upload it. See Convert Video to MP4 for details.
3
Upload videos when you have a strong connection. If you're on mobile, you may have difficulties uploading if you have a spotty connection. Try to upload videos while connected to Wi-Fi with a strong signal.
Uploading takes a lot longer than downloading, so you'll likely have to wait a while for larger videos to upload.
Tips
Facebook should not be considered a video storage service, as there is no guarantee that old videos will not be deleted after a time or pulled down if they violate Facebook's terms.
