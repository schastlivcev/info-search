So, you're on Quotev and you see those amazing writers with loads of followers and fans. You think "Why can't I be like that?" You can be, just follow these steps.
Part 1
Part 1 of 3:Opening an Account
1
Create an account if you don't already have one. Make your password tricky to guess, but easy for you to remember. It has to be over eight characters but make it longer to be safe.
Come up with a username to create. It could be a song lyric, your name, something you like, a quote, or anything else. Remember the username policy. There are a few simple rules: no profane/shocking language, or sexual material. Your username is what appears on your stories and next to your forum posts so make sure it sounds good and suits you.
2
Pick a URL. The same rules apply, but you cannot stylize on URL. This will be the link to your user page.

Part 2 of 3:Following and Learning from Others
1
Go on a following spree. Follow about 25-30 users but don't ask an account to follow you back, it will seem rude and immature. Most people with something similar to "follow back" in their profile will do so without prompting. There is definitely no guarantee that randomly followed accounts will even want to read your stories or follow you, however, don't let that put you off.
2
Find other popular authors and see what aspects make them popular. That way, you'll know what to do to popularize yourself on Quotev. Try to emulate them, but don't copy what they do; you want to be yourself, not a copy of someone popular.
Part 3
Part 3 of 3:Writing and Sharing
1
Start writing material. You can write anything you set your heart to except sexually explicit stories because they are against the site rules and could even get your account banned if you continue writing them.
Write what you enjoy writing. If you write about something that you enjoy, your audience will see that, and you'll have a better chance of people liking your writings.
Make your writing engaging to the readers. Be sure to know that what you write is real, begin with a statistic that shocks, and make revisions and edits to your writing. Doing these things will grab the reader's attention.
Try asking other people for advice on how you can improve your writings. Doing this will help you become a better writer.
2
Post some funny/inspiring R.A's. Post one saying that you're new like "Hi, Quotev users! I am (your name) and I love to write! Check out my story!"
3
Do not write cliches. Doing this will especially place your story down on the lower list because everyone does them. If you want to become a popular writer come up with something original.
Avoid cliches like "I'm pregnant." or "I cheated on you." Or even "They kidnapped me and beat me, but I'm in love with them." Everyone hates reading stories like that because they have been done so many times. It just gets boring actually, so come up with a story about your personality and make it original. Honestly, though, Quotev thrives off clich√©d stories. You can be original, or you could churn out the same storyline every twelve-year-old on the site's been using. Sadly the latter will earn more fans, so it really lies in what your priorities are - do you want readers, or to write stories you care about while running the risk of them going unnoticed?
4
Share your writings on other sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and online forums.  Sharing your writings outside of Quotev is a good way to attract more readers, and thus will boost your popularity as a Quotev author.  Provide a link to your writings so others can read them.
5
Be an active updater. Keep updating even if you don't have many readers. Make posts frequently and reply to comments swiftly. Thank your readers often. You definitely shouldn't let your readers control your schedule. Your writing should be a fun hobby, not another assignment. Remind them firmly that you do, in fact, have a life outside of working for them.
You can't just disappear for three weeks when you have left a cliffhanger. This is not to say that you can't disappear. Your readers get that you have a personal life. It is just that you have to prepare them first.
6
Share your stories in the "Share your story" section in Groups.
Tips
Be funny and interact with your followers.
Try writing something different than what's already out there.
Be nice at all times. What's printed stays printed.
You can use your Quotev account life a Facebook. Post RA's as if you were talking to your best friend. It helps to make friends.
You could write about something every teenager can relate to.
Patience is a major component. You can't expect to publish your story one day and have 1,000 followers by the next.
Be social, and comment nicely about an author's story to make a good first impression; making you interest for other Quotev users!
Ensure that your grammar is perfect, as well as your spelling. You need paragraphs to make the chapter organized and not confusing.
If you need inspiration for fanfiction, look at imagines, or even YouTube comments on a person's video. Something like that can be fleshed out and turned into a lengthy story.
Try to write an outline of your story before the writing process. This way, you're less likely to run out of ideas or lose the focus of your story.
Adding tags to your story could help people find it when they're searching it in the index. Only add tags that are relevant to your story, however, as categorizing your story incorrectly could result in it being removed from the site index
Give your story a cover. Not only does this encourage more people to click on it, but stories without covers are hidden from the site index!
